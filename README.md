# Ni3Al-atomic-ordering
A pipeline to compute Warren-Cowley atomic ordering parameters 

This set of utility functions is designed to parse POSCAR data generated by Monte Carlo DFT simulations of crystal evolution in Ni3Al ternary alloys. Functionality exists to:
* Load raw POSCAR outputs into structured tabular form
* Compute the Warren-Cowley short-range ordering parameter for all species pairs in an ASE Atoms object
* Track the trajectory of Warren-Cowley ordering over the course of a Monte Carlo simulation run
* Generate representative plots of these ordering trajectories for the duration of each simulation
